[Math Expression](https://www.testdome.com/questions/javascript/math-expression/114941)

- [ ] The function will both, validate an expression, and report the reason for any errors encountered.
- [ ] The function will return _false_ for an expression having mathematical operators with different precedence.
- [x] The function will work correctly if _Set_(s) are removed and the _pairs_ _object_ is used instead of them.
- [ ] Using _if..else,_ instead of a _Set_ and the _pairs_ object to check for brackets in the loop reduces the number of code changes needed to handle new bracket types.
- [x] The function will work correctly if the expression is made up of numbers and mathematical operators.
- [ ] The function will iterate through the entire string for expressions like "[3 + 5 x (4-1] - 39]".
